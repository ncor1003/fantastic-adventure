		<h2>The Emperor</h2>
		<p>
			Emperor Qin ordered the construction of his tomb when he was only 13 years old, an order that involved hundreds of thousands of workers and thirty-six years to complete. It is also believed that Qin ordered that the tomb workers and supervisors 			involved in its design be buried alive to protect its secrets.
		</p>
		<p>
			This amazing but meglomaniac man conquered and united China from a collection of warring states to become its First Emperor. He built the Great Wall and amassed great works of art. Obsessed with a quest for the secret of immortality, 70,000 				workers built his tomb said to be filled with legendary   treasures. His 3000 wives and concubines followed him to the grave.

		</p>
		<p>
			He became famous for unifying the warring states into what is now China, and for becoming the country's first emperor. He is remembered for instigating the building of the Great Wall of China, and the fanatical fear of death and an obsessive quest 			for the secret of immortality. This craze for life and the fear of death ultimately gave us the legacy of the terracotta warriors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among other accomplishments, the emperor standardized weights and measures and introduced a uniform writing script. He then invested in infrastructure and built massive fortifications. His road network likely exceeded 4,000 miles, including 40 			foot-wide speedways with a central lane reserved for the imperial family. On the northern frontier, the emperor dispatched his most trusted general to reinforce and connect existing border barriers, creating a bulwark against nomadic marauders.
			Made of rammed earth and rubble, these fortifications became the basis for the Great Wall, most of which would be rebuilt in stone and brick during the 15th century A.D. under the Ming dynasty.
		</p>
		<p>
			For all Chinese people, he is our ancestor, and for what he did for China, we cannot unearth his tomb just because archaeologists or people doing tourism want to know what is buried there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Qin Shi Huangdi may have conquered China with his army, but he held it together with a civil administration system that endured for centuries.
