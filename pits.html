		<h2>The Museum Pits</h2>
		<h3>Pit 1</h3>
		<p>
			The first part of the Terracotta Army site to be discovered was named Pit 1. It has 11 corridors, most of which are over 3 meters wide, and paved with small bricks. A wooden ceiling is supported by large beams and posts. This design was also used 			for the tombs of noblemen and resembled palace hallways. The wooden ceilings were covered with reed mats and layers of clay for waterproofing, and then mounded with more soil making them about 2 to 3 meters higher than ground level.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sculpted by 750,000 people over a period of 38 years, the life size terracotta soldiers and their horses stand in battle formation to protect the Emperor in the afterlife. Amazingly, every figure differs in facial features and expressions. The 			head, arms, legs and torsos were created separately and then assembled. Studies show that eight face moulds were most likely used, and then clay was added to provide individual facial features.
		</p>
		<h3>Pits 2 and 3</h3>
		<p>
			In 1976, two other vaults were uncovered 20-25 meters from Pit One, and were named Pit Two and Pit Three. Current estimates are that in the three pits containing the Terracotta Army there were over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and   			150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pit two has cavalry and infantry units as well as war chariots, and is thought to represent a military guard.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pit three is the command post, with high ranking officers and a war chariot.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pit four is empty, seemingly left unfinished by its builders.
