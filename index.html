		<h2>The Discovery</h2>
		<p>
			In March of 1974, local farmers digging a well uncovered one of the greatest archaeological sites in the world. <em>The Terracotta Army of Emperor QinShihuang</em> was discovered in Tong County, 30 kilometers from Xian, China, in Shaani Province. 			While digging, they unearthed pottery fragments and ancient bronze weapons which attracted the interest of the National Historical and Cultural Relics Administration.* Excavations and explorations began in July, 1974, and Emperor QinShihuang's 			Terracotta Museum opened to the public on October 1, 1979.		
		</p>
		<h3>The Museum</h3>
		<p>
			When archaeologists began excavating what is now known as Pit 1, they uncovered remnants of life-size statues of warriors and horses in battle formation. As they continued to excavate, they uncovered Pits 2 and 3, and discovered pieces of life-size 			bronze chariots and horses. After 20 years as an active archaeological dig, over 35,000 sq. meters have been excavated, over 8000 warriors and two complete bronze chariots with horses have been reconstructed, and a large collection of armor, 				helmets, bronze animals and artifacts have been unearthed, making this the largest on-site museum in China. Excavation and restoration continues today.
